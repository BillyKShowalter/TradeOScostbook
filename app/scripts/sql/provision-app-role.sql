-- Idempotently creates (or updates the password/attributes of) the
-- restricted application role, then grants it the same permissions on
-- every existing table/sequence/function in the public schema, and sets
-- default privileges so future migrations don't silently leave new objects
-- ungranted until someone remembers to re-run this script.
--
-- Invoked via psql -v role_name=... -v role_password=... — never edit this
-- file to hardcode a real password.
-- psql variable interpolation (:'var') doesn't happen inside dollar-quoted
-- (DO $$ ... $$) blocks, so the create-or-alter branch is built and run via
-- \gexec instead of PL/pgSQL — substitution works normally here since
-- nothing below is dollar-quoted.
--
-- The ALTER branch deliberately omits nosuperuser/nocreatedb/nocreaterole
-- (only re-asserted on CREATE, where they're required to be specified at
-- all): PostgreSQL requires the *executing* role to itself be a true
-- superuser to touch the SUPERUSER/NOSUPERUSER clause in an ALTER ROLE
-- statement, regardless of direction or the target's current value — even
-- though CREATEROLE alone is sufficient to specify it on CREATE ROLE. On
-- Supabase, the admin `postgres` role has CREATEROLE but is not a true
-- superuser, so re-running this script against an already-provisioned
-- role failed with "permission denied to alter role" until this was split.
