"""Canonical, marker-validated repo/package-root resolver for the knowledge-engine pipeline.

Phase B path-canonicalization helper. See packages/knowledge-engine/PATHS.md for the full
path contract this implements. Mirrors the dual-marker safety property of
app/modules/knowledge-runtime/loader.ts's resolveKnowledgeEnginePaths(), generalized to a
bounded upward directory walk so it converges on the true repo root from anywhere inside
the tree -- including, deliberately, from inside packages/knowledge-engine/knowledge-engine/
(the confirmed self-nested duplicate), which has no app/ sibling and therefore can never
itself satisfy both markers.

This module's own file location (not the caller's) anchors the search, so every consumer
gets the same trustworthy starting point regardless of how it was invoked.
