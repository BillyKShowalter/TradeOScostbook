# TradeOS Deployment Guide

## Overview

TradeOS deploys as two applications:

- `app/` — Express + TypeScript backend API
- `web/` — Next.js frontend

Production posture for RC1:

- authenticated API access through bearer JWTs
- org-scoped authorization in application code
- forced PostgreSQL row-level security in the database
- tracked Prisma migrations for schema and RLS policy rollout
- request IDs and structured JSON logs on the API

## Deployment model

### Backend

The backend can run in either of these modes:

- long-lived Node process using `app/backend/start.ts`
- serverless deployment using `app/index.ts`

For long-lived deployments, the API can also run the in-process supplier sync scheduler when configured.

For serverless deployments, do not rely on the in-process scheduler. Use the one-shot job runner from external cron or an equivalent platform scheduler.

### Frontend

The frontend is a standard Next.js app that talks to the backend over `BACKEND_API_URL`.

Server components and server actions call the backend directly on the server.
Client components use the same-origin proxy route so bearer tokens stay out of browser JavaScript.

## Required environment variables

### Backend required

- `DATABASE_URL`
  Use the restricted application role, not the admin database user.
- `DATABASE_ADMIN_URL`
  Required for migration rollout and role provisioning.
- `APP_DB_ROLE_PASSWORD`
  Required when provisioning or rotating the restricted database role.
- `AUTH_JWT_SECRET`
  Required for local/self-hosted JWT signing and verification where Supabase JWT settings are not the only auth source.
- `PLATFORM_PROVISIONING_SECRET`
  Required if using first-owner organization provisioning.

### Backend commonly required

- `PORT`
  Defaults to `4000`.
- `TRUST_PROXY`
  Set this when the app is behind a load balancer, ingress, or platform proxy.
- `ENABLE_STRICT_TRANSPORT_SECURITY`
  Set to `true` only when all production traffic is HTTPS.
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_JWT_ISSUER`
- `SUPABASE_JWT_JWKS_URL`
- `SUPABASE_JWT_AUDIENCE`
- `AUTH_ISSUER`
- `AUTH_AUDIENCE`
- `RLS_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `PLATFORM_PROVISIONING_ALLOWED_IPS`
- `PLATFORM_PROVISIONING_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`
- `PLATFORM_PROVISIONING_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`

### Backend optional supplier sync variables

- `SUPPLIER_PRICE_SYNC_CRON_SCHEDULE`
- `SUPPLIER_PRICE_SYNC_JOBS`

If both are set, the long-lived backend process starts the in-process scheduler.
If either is missing, the scheduler stays off.

### Frontend required

- `BACKEND_API_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

### Frontend storage-related

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET_PUBLIC`

## Local deployment flow

### Backend

```bash
cd app
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run db:deploy
npm run prisma:generate
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd web
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

## Production rollout steps

### 1. Prepare secrets

Populate production secrets for:

- database admin connection
- restricted app-role password
- backend runtime database URL
- JWT and Supabase auth configuration
- provisioning secret
- frontend runtime variables

Do not use the admin database connection as `DATABASE_URL`.

### 2. Roll out database changes

From `app/`:

```bash
npm run db:deploy
```

This is the canonical production migration command.
It does two things:

1. runs `prisma migrate deploy` against `DATABASE_ADMIN_URL`
2. reprovisions the restricted app role if `APP_DB_ROLE_PASSWORD` is set

### 3. Build the applications

Backend:

```bash
cd app
npm run build
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd web
npm run build
```

### 4. Deploy the backend

For a long-lived process deployment:

```bash
cd app
npm start
```

For serverless deployment, deploy the project entrypoint that uses `app/index.ts`.

### 5. Deploy the frontend

Deploy the `web/` application with its production environment variables pointed at the deployed backend.

## Proxy and HTTPS guidance

### `TRUST_PROXY`

Set `TRUST_PROXY` when the app is behind:

- a reverse proxy
- a load balancer
- ingress
- a platform runtime that forwards client IP and protocol

Examples:

- `TRUST_PROXY=true`
- `TRUST_PROXY=1`
- `TRUST_PROXY=loopback`

This matters for:

- correct client IP logging
- rate limiting behavior
- provisioning IP allowlists

### HSTS

Set `ENABLE_STRICT_TRANSPORT_SECURITY=true` only when:

- the backend is reachable exclusively over HTTPS
- TLS termination is correctly configured in front of the app

Do not enable HSTS for mixed HTTP/HTTPS or local environments.

## Health checks and observability

### Health endpoint

`GET /health` returns:

- `status`
- `service`
- `version`
- `timestamp`
- `uptimeSeconds`

Use this for basic liveness checks.

### Request IDs

Every API response includes `x-request-id`.

If a caller supplies `x-request-id`, the API preserves it.
Otherwise the backend generates one.

Error responses now also include `requestId` in the JSON body.

### Structured logging

The API emits JSON logs for:

- server startup
- completed requests
- unexpected request failures
- supplier sync scheduler activity

Recommended production behavior:

- ship stdout/stderr to a centralized log sink
- index by `requestId`, `path`, and `statusCode`
- alert on repeated `request.failed` and supplier sync failures

## Supplier sync deployment choices

### Option 1: in-process scheduler

Use this only for long-lived backend processes.

Set:

- `SUPPLIER_PRICE_SYNC_CRON_SCHEDULE`
- `SUPPLIER_PRICE_SYNC_JOBS`

This starts scheduled sync execution inside the API process.

### Option 2: external scheduler

Recommended for serverless or container orchestration environments.

Run:

```bash
cd app
npm run jobs:supplier-price-sync
```

on a platform scheduler such as:

- Kubernetes CronJob
- GitHub Actions scheduled workflow
- ECS scheduled task
- systemd timer
- host cron

The job exits non-zero if any configured target fails, which is better for alerting.

## Security checklist

- `DATABASE_URL` uses the restricted role, not the admin role.
- `DATABASE_ADMIN_URL` is available only to deploy tooling and trusted operators.
- `PLATFORM_PROVISIONING_SECRET` is high entropy and rotated when needed.
- provisioning routes are also protected by network controls.
- `TRUST_PROXY` is set correctly for the deployment topology.
- HSTS is enabled only on fully HTTPS production deployments.
- JWT and Supabase auth settings match the active environment.

## Verification checklist after deploy

### Backend

1. `GET /health` returns `200`.
2. signup/login or a known authenticated route succeeds.
3. one authenticated read route and one authenticated write route succeed.
4. a forced-RLS cross-org access attempt is denied.
5. logs include request IDs and structured request completion entries.

### Frontend

1. login loads and submits successfully.
2. dashboard renders with authenticated data.
3. customer and project pages resolve without backend proxy errors.
4. a PDF download route works.
5. project workspace renders photos/documents according to storage bucket visibility rules.

## Rollback guidance

### Application rollback

If a backend or frontend deploy is unhealthy but the database schema is still compatible:

1. roll back the application artifact
2. keep the database at the current migration level
3. verify health, auth, and key read/write routes

### Migration rollback

Prefer roll-forward over destructive rollback.

Because migrations include RLS and privilege-related DDL, rollback should be treated carefully:

1. stop new deploys
2. assess whether the failure is application-only or schema-related
3. if schema changes must be reversed, create a corrective forward migration where possible
4. avoid manual destructive changes outside tracked migrations unless incident response absolutely requires it

## RC1 known operational risks

- Supplier sync infrastructure is real, but live supplier feed ingestion is still not production-complete unless a real connector is added.
- Provisioning IP allowlists depend on correct proxy configuration and should not be the only network protection.
- `/health` is currently a liveness endpoint, not a full dependency-readiness probe.

## Pre-release command checklist

Backend:

```bash
cd app
npm test
npm run test:integration
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd web
npm run lint
npm run build
```

RC1 should not be considered deployment-ready until these commands pass in the release candidate environment.
