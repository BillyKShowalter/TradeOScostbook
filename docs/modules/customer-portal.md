# Customer Portal

## Purpose

Provide customer-facing document and project views for proposals, contracts, invoices, and portal project summaries.

## Source code locations

- `web/src/app/(app)/portal/**`
- `web/src/lib/document-workflow.ts`

## Core models

- portal pages consume `Project`, `Proposal`, `Contract`, `Invoice`, and their history DTOs

## Routes

- `/portal/projects/[id]`
- `/portal/proposals/[proposalId]`
- `/portal/contracts/[contractId]`
- `/portal/invoices/[invoiceId]`

## Permissions

Portal routes depend on the same authenticated web session and backend authorization model. See [RBAC_MATRIX.md](../RBAC_MATRIX.md).

## Lifecycle and statuses

Portal timelines render proposal delivery history, contract events, and invoice delivery history. See [WORKFLOW_LIFECYCLES.md](../WORKFLOW_LIFECYCLES.md).

## Tests

- currently validated through the broader web build and workflow surfaces

## Known limitations

- portal hardening remains an RC1 follow-through area

## Deferred work

- broader customer self-service behavior beyond document viewing and related project context
