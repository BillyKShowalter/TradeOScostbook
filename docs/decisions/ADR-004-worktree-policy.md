# ADR-004 Worktree Policy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Concurrent workers need isolation without long-lived branch sprawl or accidental interference with the primary checkout.

## Decision

Use one clean main worktree plus one linked worktree per active concurrent worker. Keep branches short-lived, never implement directly on main, and remove linked worktrees after merge and verification.

## Consequences

- concurrent work stays isolated
- recovery worktrees stay temporary
- cleanup must use Git worktree commands instead of destructive filesystem removal

## Alternatives considered

- permanent per-module branches
- shared edits in the primary checkout
- manual linked-worktree deletion with `rm -rf`
