# Current State

Last verified against the repository on 2026-07-15.

## Current milestone

TradeOS is in RC1 hardening.

The repository is no longer organized around MVP planning documents. The active posture is production readiness, lifecycle consistency, verification, and contractor-facing polish.

## Implemented modules

- Auth and tenancy
- CRM: customers, service addresses, customer equipment, service agreements, notes, company profile
- Projects and project workspace
- Site visit intake
- Cost book: divisions, categories, subcategories, cost items, labor, materials, equipment, assemblies
- Estimating: estimate creation, line items, duplication, comparison, AI estimate assist
- Proposals
- Contracts
- Invoices and payment recording
- Change orders
- Jobs and scheduling: job creation, assignment, scheduling, rescheduling, dispatcher coordination, and field-status workflows
- Project tasks
- Activity, notifications, recents, saved views, feature flags, and search-oriented intelligence primitives
- Brand Studio
- Settings and organization operations
- Customer portal document views
- Supplier review queue and scheduler plumbing
- Knowledge runtime integration

See module docs in `docs/modules/`.

## Partially implemented or compatibility-layer areas

- Legacy role values `estimator` and `viewer` are still tolerated in stored data but normalize to canonical roles
- Project lifecycle persistence still contains legacy values such as `proposal_sent` and `accepted`; UI and shared contracts normalize these into canonical display states
- Contract persistence still stores `pending_signature`; global lifecycle docs treat that as compatibility storage under canonical contract states
- Supplier integration feed ingestion is scaffolded around a stub fetcher; queue, review, audit, and scheduling plumbing are real
- Customer portal exists for proposal, contract, invoice, and project views, but hardening is still tracked as RC work

## Recent internal cleanup

- The dashboard (`web/src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`) now composes a "Needs attention" section from the existing per-project data fan-out it already fetches (draft/ready estimates, proposals awaiting a response, invoices that are sent, overdue, or partially paid, and projects with no estimate yet), each linking directly into the existing estimate builder, AI Estimate Assist, proposal, and invoice pages. AI assist is only offered for draft estimates, since a `ready` estimate's line items are locked. No new backend endpoints, aggregation service, or design system were introduced; the new `web/src/components/dashboard/needs-attention-card.tsx` component reuses `Card`, `StatusBadge`, `EmptyState`, and `Button` plus the existing `createEstimateAction` server action.
- The AI Estimate Assist review panel (`web/src/components/estimate-assist/ai-estimate-assist.tsx`) now also surfaces the resolved target's `matchMethod` (already returned by the backend but previously unused by the frontend) next to the existing match-score badge, making the "why this was matched" provenance more visible without adding any new backend field.
- Five duplicate private `round2()` rounding helpers (in `cost-database`, `assemblies-database`, `change-orders`, `estimate-engine`, and `knowledge-runtime` services) were consolidated to import the one already exported from `app/modules/estimate-engine/formulas.ts`. No rounding behavior changed.
- Four internal-only exports (`mapPrismaKnownRequestError`, `CreateOrganizationInput`, `SupplierPriceUpdateStatus`, `SupplierFeedQuote`, `ClientApiError`) had their `export` keyword removed after confirming no other file imports them.
- Confirmed-dead frontend code was removed: the unused shadcn `Select` primitive (`web/src/components/ui/select.tsx`), an unwired AI-suggestions component pair, an unused project-files panel, and a dead Supabase browser-client wrapper (`web/src/lib/supabase/client.ts`) that had already been superseded by server-side `@supabase/ssr` usage.
- Unused `web/src/lib/api.ts` helpers (`signup`, `login`, `AuthSession`, `listProposalsByProject`, `listInvoicesByProject`) were removed after confirming the real auth path calls Supabase directly from Server Actions and that no caller used the two list helpers.
- `claude.md` was renamed to `CLAUDE.md` — both names pointed at the same file only because of this machine's case-insensitive filesystem; git tracked the lowercase name, which would not resolve as `CLAUDE.md` on a case-sensitive filesystem (Linux CI, most Docker images).
- Explicitly *not* removed: `web/src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx` and the `lucide-react` dependency — both are live (used by Brand Studio and Settings consoles), and `@supabase/supabase-js` — it is a required peer dependency of the actively-used `@supabase/ssr` package, not a dead dependency.

## Known blockers and unresolved technical debt

- Supplier feed connectors are not live
- Cost-item and assembly combined name-or-code substring search can still degrade into scan-heavy plans because only `name` columns are trigram-indexed today
- Documentation governance was missing before this branch and is being added here
- Production deployment state and environment approvals are not inferred from code and must be verified per environment
- Some older implementation notes and planning artifacts required archiving because they conflicted with the live repository

## Recent verified infrastructure facts

- migration `20260703090000_add_search_trgm_indexes` enables PostgreSQL `pg_trgm`
- the migration adds GIN trigram indexes on `cost_items.name`, `assemblies.name`, `materials.name`, and `suppliers.name`
- this supports the current case-insensitive substring-search behavior used by cost-item and assembly name search, and it covers representative name-search patterns for materials and future supplier search surfaces
- RLS behavior is unchanged because the indexes only affect query planning, not tenancy enforcement
- verification state: the migration is merged on `main`; the PR notes local migration and `EXPLAIN` verification on a throwaway Postgres 18 cluster, while the repository's own `npm run test:integration` harness was still recommended separately in that PR

## Current verification surface

Backend commands defined in `app/package.json`:

- `npm test`
- `npm run test:integration`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`

Frontend commands defined in `web/package.json`:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`

Current CI workflows:

- `.github/workflows/verify-repository.yml` runs backend lint, unit tests, build, integration tests, and frontend lint/build
- `.github/workflows/deploy-migrations.yml` runs tracked database rollout logic for migration changes
