# TradeOS 50-Sprint Backlog

Status vocabulary: `DONE`, `IN_REVIEW`, `READY`, `BLOCKED`, `PLANNED`, `DEFERRED`, `CANCELLED`.

## Next Eligible Sprint

Selection is determined by `docs/agent-prompts/NEXT_SPRINT_PROTOCOL.md` after checking live PRs and dependencies. As of this file's creation, candidates are S003 and S006; S003 is lower-numbered and therefore selected first if the live ruleset still needs calibration.
